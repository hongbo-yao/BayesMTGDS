# BayesMTGDS

BayesMTGDS is a standalone C++ code for trans-dimensional Bayesian joint inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) and geomagnetic depth sounding (GDS) responses. Supported data and transfer functions include:

- MT apparent resistivity and phase

- GDS global Qn and Cn responses (a global network of geomagnetic observatory data, satellite data; magnetospheric ring current and ionospheric Sq current (not recommended))

- GDS local Cn responses (single site ground-based data; magnetospheric ring current and ionospheric Sq current (not recommended))

- GDS global-to-local transfer functions (single site ground-based data; magnetospheric ring current and ionospheric Sq current)
